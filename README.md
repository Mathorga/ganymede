Spiking neural network implementation in pure C (and CUDA)

## How to compile
### Static library installation
Run `make` or `make all` to install all packages as a system-wide dynamic library (only works on linux at the moment).<br/>
Run `make standard` to install the CPU package as a system-wide dynamic library (only works on linux at the moment).<br/>
Run `make cuda` to install the CUDA GPU package as a system-wide dynamic library (only works on linux at the moment).<br/>
Run `make uninstall` to uninstall any previous installation.

## TODO
Full CUDA support
